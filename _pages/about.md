Hi, I am Nengxin Mou. I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Hohai University**.

My research interests lie broadly in **Robotics and Artificial Intelligence**, with a specific focus on **UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)**, **Motion Planning (RRT*)**, and **3D Perception**. I enjoy the process of turning algorithms into real-world applications.

Currently, I am a research intern at **CUHK-Shenzhen**, working on UAV monitoring and obstacle avoidance algorithms.

**🔥 I am actively seeking a research internship for Summer 2025.**
